# hello-world
practice creating repositories/pull requests,etc.
I am 43 years young Artist and I'm trying to learn about nft's. It has led me down a rabbit hole currently landed in github. It's all hugely foreign to me and pretty exciting at the same time. My only drive in this life is to never stop learning and advancing myself and the collective, respectively.
